##Introduction

This repository aims to be a portfolio of my work during the 'Applied Data Science With Python' specialization created by the University of Michigan on Coursera. It also serves me as a back up of various tips & tricks used for data cleansing, manipulation, model training & visualization.

The specialization consists of the following courses:

Introduction to Data Science in Python
Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python
Applied Machine Learning in Python
Applied Text Mining in Python
Applied Social Network Analysis in Python

Overrall I greatly enjoyed the course & would encourage it to anyone interested in getting started with data science I did the 'Python for Everbody' course prior to this to get my coding skills up to scratch.
